Keybox management, security spoofing, and detection avoidance: clean, focused, no bloat.

The module is clean by design: that's what makes it the right choice, not bloat and gimmicks like others. With a clean webUI that gives you the best experience.

## Background

Specter is a complete rewrite of what I originally built as Yurikey. After the rewrite was turned down by Yuri, I went my own way.

## Support

If Specter helps you out, consider supporting the project:

- Ko-fi: [ko-fi.com/dpejoh](https://ko-fi.com/dpejoh)
- PayPal: dpejoh@atomicmail.io
- BTC: bc1qfy4vfstns4aqhvck66x0r53n3hfkkzhwkt7zpw
- ETC: 0x895762C0Fd2BeF54EE3cD478Fc03212aeA673a68

## Quick start

1. Install any PIF fork such as [Play Integrity Fix](https://github.com/KOWX712/PlayIntegrityFix/releases/latest) or [Play Integrity Fork](https://github.com/osm0sis/PlayIntegrityFork/releases/latest)
2. Install [Tricky Store](https://github.com/5ec1cff/TrickyStore/releases/latest) or any fork such as [TEESimulator](https://github.com/JingMatrix/TEESimulator) or [TEESimulator-RS](https://github.com/Enginex0/TEESimulator-RS)
3. Install Specter via Magisk / KernelSU / APatch
4. Open the WebUI and configure as you like

## Features

- **Keybox**: multi-source catalog, custom keybox (file/URL/path), Google revocation checking, private keybox support, backup and restore
- **Tools**: target.txt, App Targeting (per-app states + blacklist), security patch with live fetch from source.android.com, TEESimulator support, GMS kill, PIF fix, HMA-OSS / Zygisk Next configs, detection cleanup, Widevine L1
- **Control**: per-feature toggles (boot hardening, boot state props, bootloader spoofer block, ROM spoof blocking, LSPosed clean, recovery hide, action pipeline steps), automatic conflict resolution (aggressive: TSupport-Advance/Yurikey/Integrity Box disabled; passive: TreatWheel/NoHello/Sensitive Props coexist)
- **Settings**: theme (dark/light/auto + 9 color presets + Monet), language, dev mode with terminal, project contributors

## Requirements

- Root access (Magisk / KernelSU / APatch)
- Tricky Store
- Play Integrity Fix or any fork (recommended)

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dpejoh/specter
cd specter
npm install
npm run build
```

Output: `Specter-v{version}.zip`

### Testing

```bash
# Shell tests (boot scripts, features)
bash tests/run.sh

# Unit tests (vitest, happy-dom)
npm test

# Unit tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# E2E browser smoke tests (Playwright)
npm run test:e2e

# TypeScript type check
npx tsc --noEmit
```

Shell tests validate boot scripts and feature behavior in a mock environment (112 tests). TypeScript unit tests cover the WebUI bridge, config layer, toast, colour utilities, and helpers (84 tests). E2E tests verify the built HTML loads correctly in a real browser.

CI enforces:
- TypeScript strict compilation (`tsc --noEmit`)
- ShellCheck linting (severity: warning)
- Shell test suite (16 tests)
- TypeScript test suite (65+ tests, vitest + happy-dom)
- Module structure verification
- No hardcoded `/data/adb/modules/Specter` paths in lib/ or features/
- No `su -c` usage in feature scripts
